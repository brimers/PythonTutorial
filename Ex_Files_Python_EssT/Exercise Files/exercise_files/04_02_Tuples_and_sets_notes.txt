Tuples:
() to declare
much like lists
ordered, subscriptable but immutable
memory is static
used by default


Sets:

{} to declare
order doesnt matter
elements are unique
cant fetch by index, nonsubscriptable
thought of as more of a pile

add(value) to append
.pop() like a queue but order is not guaranteed
.discard(value) to discard

set(listName) to remove duplicates
